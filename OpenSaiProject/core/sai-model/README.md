# Sai-Model

This is SAI robot model library for robot kinematics and dynamics.
It uses [RBDL](https://rbdl.bitbucket.io/) and adds function to facilitate the implementation of the whole body control framework from Stanford Robotics Lab.

## Dependencies

sai-model depends on eigen3 and sai-urdfreader.
You can get sai-urdfreader [there](https://github.com/manips-sai-org/sai-urdfreader).

To install eigen3 on Ubuntu :

```
sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev
```

on Mac :

```
brew install eigen
```

## Build instructions 

You can use the provided install script for automatic install

```
sh install.sh
```

Or you can install manually :
 * First go to the rbdl folder and make rbdl
 

```
cd rbdl
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. && make -j8
cd ../..
```

 * Then you can make sai-model from the base directory

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. && make -j8
```

## Run the examples

Go to the build/examples/one_of_the_examples folder and run the example. For example 1 :

```
cd build/examples/01-create_model_from_file
./01-create_model_from_file
```
