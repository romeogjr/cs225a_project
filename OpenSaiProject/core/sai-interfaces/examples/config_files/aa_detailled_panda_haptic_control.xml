The <hapticDeviceControlConfiguration> element contains the configuration for the haptic device control.
There can be multiple <hapticDeviceControlConfiguration> elements in the configuration file, each one
should correspond to a unique haptic device and a unique controlled robot task.
The attributes of the <hapticDeviceControlConfiguration> element are:
	- controlMode: the control mode of the haptic device. Possible values are "impedance" and "admittance". Default is "impedance".
	- switchFunction: the function of the switch. Possible values are "clutch" and "orientationControl". Default is "clutch".
		Clutch means that the switch is used to enable/disable the haptic control (move the haptic device without moving the robot).
		OrientationControl means that the switch is used to switch between translation only, and translation plus orientation control.
	- switchUsageType: the usage type of the switch. Possible values are "click" and "hold". Default is "click".
